<h2 id="sec-4">Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>
Don't learn Python by reading answers on Stack Overflow. 
</p>

<p>
Ok, you can learn some things, but you may find you need to later unlearn things. 
</p>

<p>
However, it is probably safe to read answers written by yours truly.
</p>

<p>
I have written a lot of answers to questions on StackOverflow. My
motivation is usually my dissatisfaction with the accepted answer
and other top answers on the question. I try to write what I 
consider to be outstanding answers to the questions.
</p>

<p>
What makes an outstanding answer? To me, answers that are technically precise,
demonstrably correct, and directly communicate the important points are 
great answers.
</p>

<p>
On Stack Overflow, they advertise that the best answers rise to the top.
This condition does not always hold. New great answers are still 
ranked (by default) way below answers that have been there for years,
and yet have only gathered a few votes. This issue could be 
addressed by allowing users to sort by recent votes, but this feature
may never appear.
</p>

<aside>
<p>
I'm in the top .5% of all time (actually top .36% as of this writing,
but who's keeping score?) on Stack Overflow.
</p>

  </img>
</a>
</aside>

<p>
My top <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/541136/aaron-hall?tab=answers&sort=votes">100 or so answers</a> are probably worth reading. 
I've kinda organized my answers with over 8 upvotes here.
</p>

<p>
Note that I'm linking to the questions,
not specifically my answers, so use Ctrl-f and search for my name 
to find my answers. 
</p>

<p>
Also note that the stated ethos of the site is that the 
best answers rise to the top. 
</p>

<p>
That can actually take years.
</p>

<p>
We can improve the speed of the sorting algorithm by voting up good answers
and voting down poor ones. So while you're reading content on Stack Overflow, 
remember to vote early and often.

These answers will cover creation and usage of functions.
</p>

<p>
In Python, everything is an object. Functions are also objects.
That makes it easy to make functions first class citizens.
</p>

<p>
Functions are instantiated by function definitions and lambda statements.
I recommend function definitions over lambdas in Python. Lambdas 
are basically severely limited functions - they don't know their 
name or have a docstring, and you can only give them a simple statement
to return.
</p>

<p>
Note also that list comps and generator expressions have subsumed
map and filter in Python.

<h2 id="sec-5">How to contribute on Stack Overflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
It's kinda hard. It's competitive. They've "gamified" answering questions. 
They have a <b>lot</b> of new people all the time and limit damage a new account can cause, 
you get privileges incrementally as you earn reputation points.
</p>

<p>
You do start off being able to ask and answer questions, and being able to submit
edits for review. If edits are approved, you get 2 reputation points (<b>rep</b>). If your question
is upvoted, you get 5 rep. If your answer is upvoted, you get 10 rep.
If your answer is accepted by the asker, you get 15 rep. Sometimes bounties are offered on questions.
There's a rep cap of 200 per day, but accepts and bounties don't count toward the cap.
</p>

<p>
Edits are an easy way to get over the early participation hurdles. So pull out Strunk and White,
and get to fixing spelling and grammar errors, and removing cruft like sign-offs and apologies. 
Do <b>not</b> change code (except to fix formatting), or change the meaning of answers,
unless it's <b>your</b> answer.
</p>

<p>
Next, answer questions. It's easier than asking. All the good questions have been asked.
Not all of the good answers have been given. You can try to earn rep fast by 
answering new questions that are liable to be closed as dupes and see maybe 100 views over 
the next decade. Or you can try to write really good canonical answers to canonical
questions, like me. Up to you.
</p>

<p>
To get upvotes, consider Socrates on persuasion - you need ethos, pathos, and logos.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Logos: This is logic and evidence. Better communication of logic and evidence will
greatly help you succeed on the site, especially when you're starting with nothing.
With code, it's usually easy to demonstrate you have something that works, but
you still need to back up your recommendations with strong and readily acceptable 
reasoning. 
</li>
<li>Pathos: This is how you say what you say. For a speaker, it's the emotion conveyed
by the words. A disconnect can hurt you. If you have a strong tone (and you're right), 
you'll usually get more upvotes. I have a personal bias against tone. This
probably hurts me, when I say "don't do this" and don't say *"I mean really never 
ever do this."*
</li>
<li>Ethos: This the credibility of the speaker/author. 
The major source of credibility on Stack Overflow is your reputation point count.
For better or worse, you can get away with less of the other two if you have this.
I'm sure I have some material that now benefits from my higher reputation count,
but in the beginning, everything I posted was greeted with scepticism and required
my appeals to Logos to carry me.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/21542694/541136">The last answer here</a> is a really good example of how not to answer on Stack Overflow. 
The advice given is perfectly correct, but it's barely a single complete sentence,
it's written in a very informal style, and as a result, it has 0 upvotes. The user
sits at 1 reputation point as well.
</p>

<p>
Some people have had a lot of success in asking good questions. Not me. 
If you manage to create a formula for demonstrable success in asking questions, 
let me know how.

<h2 id="sec-6">Linux</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
If you like to have as much control of your operating system as possible,
I highly recommend installing a distribution of Linux, like Ubuntu,
Debian, or Fedora.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">My Linux Story</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
Although I always used their software, I've always been very frustrated 
with Microsoft's opacity and lack of documentation.
</p>

<p>
I have been aware of Linux since the early 90s,
(with all the computer magazines in the computer software stores, who
could miss the penguin and inquire about him).
</p>

<p>
I was told, "Use Windows if you want to learn how Windows works.
If you want to learn how computers work, use Linux."
</p>

<p>
After much study, ensuring I had the software I needed (office and development
software, basically everything but games) I decided to install Linux. 
</p>

<p>
I started by dual booting Linux and Windows, and when I found that I was 
only rarely using Windows at all, I began to only access Windows
from a virtual machine.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">To install Linux</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
Installing Linux is fairly simple.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a bootable thumbdrive or CD (google for <code>unetbootin</code>).
</li>
<li>Boot the computer you want to install it on from that.
</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to install it.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that if you're not careful, or even if you are and 
something goes wrong, you could wipe any other operating systems
you may have installed (like Windows). So backup your data.
</p>

<p>
If you want to dual boot, it's a little more complicated,
but Ubuntu's current installer seems to handle it well..
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to run Windows in a virtual machine (which is 
really easy).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
If this topic interests you, you're either new to Python,
helping others new to Python, or second guessing your current setup.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to do this. If you're just beginning with Python
I'd recommend you download and use the Anaconda distribution.
</p>

<p>
If you're doing this for work, do what your boss says. If you're
the boss, and you're checking this out, your people should probably
be using pip with virtual environments - unless they've worked out something
far more sophisticated.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-1">python.org and pip</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
You can also get Python from the <a href="https://www.python.org">official site</a>.
If you go that route, you'll want to use pip to install packages. 
</p>

<p>
People used to have trouble installing libraries with
compiled C extensions with pip, but I understand that this
is now improved.
</p>

<p>
You should be careful to
only use it to install to your user area. I understand Ubuntu
does this for pip by default, but other operating systems 
might not be so thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
You should probably use pip with virtual environments. 
There are lots of great tutorials on how to do that.

<h3 id="sec-7-2">Anaconda</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a> installs a new Python in your user area, along with
many other commonly used libraries. I like it for teaching and
for beginners because it's a one-shot install of most things 
you want, and a one-shot remove if you don't like it.
</p>

<p>
It comes with 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lots of packages not already in the standard library, for example: 
numpy, pandas, requests, and flask.
</li>
<li>a package manager that can install other things: conda - it can even 
install R too. 
</li>
<li>an IDE: SPyDEr (should work out of the box without configuration, too.)
</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook - a local app that lets you run Python (and
other interactive languages) in your browser.

<h2 id="sec-8">How to learn Python</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
As a best practice, I recommend using <a href="http://docs.python.org">the official docs</a>.
If you're just learning, I think starting with Python 3 is just fine
unless you expect to be working somewhere that is on Python 2 for the near future.
</p>

<p>
It's easy to learn the difference, at which point you'll know both.
</p>

<p>
If you <b>really</b> study the commonly used stuff, and at least become aware
of the things you don't know, you'll be a capable Python programmer before you know it.
</p>

<p>
Consider the below items only slightly ordered, and don't let being blocked on any
one item prevent you from going on to the next.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you could pre-order the book I intend to write. Nothing like impatient customers
to drive me to write about Python.

it in the future.

<h3 id="sec-9-3">Spacemacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
Spacemacs allows you to quickly install a "layer" of packages with a 
single entry in the <code>.spacemacs</code> file, a dotfile 
(a dotfile is a hidden config file in your home directory, Linux/Unix will hide it.)
</p>

<p>
It's super easy to install (assuming you have git and are in your home directory),
if you already have a <code>.emacs.d</code> directory, you should move it first:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This gets you the latest spacemacs version and drops it right where your <code>.emacs.d</code>
directory should be (move your old one first, if you have one).
</p>

<p>
An example of a layer is <code>python</code>. Adding that to your <code>.spacemacs</code> dotfile 
causes emacs to ensure that you have over 20 packages installed that are
relevant to programming in Python, and that shouldn't conflict with each other.
</p>

<p>
Troubleshooting Spacemacs: Sometimes things go wrong. I'm not always sure why. 
The issue has usually been something to do with compiled emacs lisp (elisp)
files becoming incompatible with each other. The fix has been pretty easy so far.
I've alternately uninstalled and reinstalled emacs, and deleted the elpa directory
from my .emacs.d directory, and when I relaunched emacs, then (almost) everything
reinstalled properly and works. 
</p>

<p>
I was putting up with the UX issues to learn it better and expand my horizons.
I've gone back to regular emacs to learn more about emacs.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-4">
<p>
Orgmode is a (now builtin) mode in Emacs that uses a hierarchical outline
format to organize information in files. 
</p>

<p>
It's a type of markdown, but it's quite sophisticated as well. 
It can be used for writing material for publication or presentations, 
via pdf or web format.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I'm building this page with Orgmode.
</p>

<p>
To use Orgmode, just open a file with .org as the suffix, and start writing.
